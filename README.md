Project Summary: 

This project aims to demonstrate each component of the machine learning process in both a fixed setting with a preemptively selected dataset and a dynamic setting in which web application users select their dataset and ML model of choice. The project tasks are outlined as follows: (1) data acquisition and pre-processing, (2) model building, and (3) web application development. For each task, this report details the steps taken to complete the respective task, explains the rationale for employed methodologies, provides code snippets and supporting graphics, analyzes the codeâ€™s effectiveness and performance, and communicates the findings of this model experimentation. This report will consist of a statement of the project objective and a general introduction to the project, an analysis of the three tasks outlined prior, a summary of the project in totality, and a conclusion that reflects on the key learnings and takeaways from this endeavor.
